# NorMed_neg
This is the repository for the NorMed_neg dataset: a Norwegian dataset of biomedical articles annotated with negation.


## Original dataset
The original dataset is [The Norwegian GastroSurgery Biomedical Negation Corpus](https://github.com/DebaratiSJ/NegEx-on-Norwegian-biomedical-text/blob/main/Gold%20standard%20biomedical%20corpus/Norwegian%20GastroSurgery%20Biomedical%20Negation%20Corpus.txt). It was created as part of a master's thesis at Stockholm University: [Building and evaluating the NegEx negation detection system for Norwegian biomedical text](https://daisy.dsv.su.se/fil/visa?id=233579) (Sadhukhan, 2021).

English sentences and duplicate sentences have been removed from the original dataset, and sentence splitting errors in negated sentences have been corrected manually. We have annotated the dataset according to a different annotation scheme. This is described below.

## Annotation guidelines
The annotation is based on [these guidelines](https://github.com/ltgoslo/norec_neg/blob/main/annotation_guidelines/guidelines_neg.md), which were used in the annotation of the NoReC_neg dataset, see [Negation in Norwegian: an annotated dataset](https://aclanthology.org/2021.nodalida-main.30) (MÃ¦hlum et al., NoDaLiDa 2021).

Some additional assumptions have been made. These are described in Chapter 5 of my master's thesis. (The link will be posted when my thesis is made publicly accessible.)
