This config contains the same entities and relations as the original NoReC_neg annotation config, which we obtained from the NoReC_neg authors. 
In addition, it contains the entity 'Focus' and the relation 'HasFocus' from Cue to Focus. 
This is done to include the negated terms (here called Focus) as annotated in the original dataset.
